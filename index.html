  The New York City Department of Sanitation is partnering with the Department of Education to explore options for more efficient trash disposal in West Harlem public schools.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Trash in West Harlem is a longstanding issue that became more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce trash in West Harlem, some local activists and community leaders believe community and municipal interventions must collaborate on solutions such as composting.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch visited a Harlem school with community members two weeks ago, and it is clear that this neighborhood needs better and more innovative trash management solutions,” DSNY press secretary Vincent Gragnani wrote in a statement to Spectator. “We are working with DOE to put a plan into action.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The initiative comes on the heels of a rat mitigation legislation package the City Council passed this past November. Dubbed the “Rat Action Plan,” the legislation aims to mitigate rat infestation issues by reducing the amount of time that trash is left on the street.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Some community members have made their grievances known to both the city and local organizations. Tisch’s visit followed over 1,200 complaint calls made in 2022 related to rodents and trash in Community Board 9, which includes West Harlem. These complaints included rodent sightings and trash disposal conditions, such as trash buildup on the street.

  Last Thursday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced his preliminary budget for the 2024 fiscal year, which included the allocation of an additional $1.8 million toward the expansion of the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/028-23/mayor-adams-releases-preliminary-budget-fiscal-year-2024#/0">Neighborhood Rat Reduction Initiative into Harlem</a>. The initiative, first launched in 2017 by the Health Department and other city agencies, combats rat infestation by removing habitats and food sources for rats.

            <p class="g-body subhed">The Trash Problem</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When community organizations like WE ACT for Environmental Justice<i>,</i> an organization dedicated to addressing issues of environmental racism, ask community members about the biggest problems they are facing, trash is often one of them.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Seventy percent of the time, it’s the waste, it’s garbage, it’s pests,” Annie Carforo, climate justice campaigns coordinator at WE ACT, said. “So this is a huge problem.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In addition to an increase of pests which carry vector-borne diseases, litter and street trash have been linked to ecological harm to neighborhood plants and animals, increased crime rates and fear of harm, and reduced park use and physical activity by residents.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The sight [of trash] leads to a sense of disorder when there’s garbage everywhere,” Steve Cohen, senior vice dean of the Columbia School of Professional Studies, said. Cohen’s work focuses on sustainable urban policy. “It’s not just aesthetics. It also leads to a sort of psychological sense that things are not quite right as you walk on the street,” he said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Karen Asner, a Hamilton Heights resident and president of the Friends of St. Nicholas Park, also observed that community regard for cleanliness increases when there is less street trash.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The cleaner we keep our park and the cleaner we keep our streets, the more people are likely to keep them clean,” Asner said. “And that is definitely something we saw in [St. Nicholas Park] as well. People see trash laying around and they think no one cares and it can contribute to a culture of trash. If it’s clean and they see a lot of receptacles and the’'re not overflowing, people are more likely to use them.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Carforo said that a big cause of the trash management issue in West Harlem is the lack of places to dispose of trash, whereas there is a disproportionate amount of trash bins in wealthier and often whiter neighborhoods.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But whenever WE ACT proposed to increase the number of waste bins in West Harlem and Upper Manhattan to DSNY, Carforo said, a common rebuttal was that more waste bins would generate more trash buildup.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “But that seems to only be true in certain neighborhoods and not in others,” Carforo said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the DSNY’s statement, press secretary Gragnani wrote that there are over <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DSNY-Litter-Basket-Map-/d6m8-cwh9">23,000 litter baskets</a> across the city, meant to hold “walking trash only—like coffee cups and candy wrappers” and that they are “in the process of installing roughly 250 ‘smart’ compost bins across the city.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body subhed">Current Trash Collection</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to Carforo, when the city began initiatives to reduce trash such as the Clean Curbs Pilot Program, which installs containerized and rodent-proof trash bins, the initiatives were not adequately allocated to neighborhoods like West Harlem.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We need to be directing and prioritizing communities that are dealing with these problems for the longest and frankly, the worst, which often unfortunately tend to be communities of color,” Carforo said. “And that is not by coincidence.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Asner believes a more equitable distribution of trash bins could help reduce rat sightings and trash buildup around West Harlem.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think that there could be more trash receptacles for certain and probably better trash receptacles so that things don’t blow out, or that they’re not a magnet for rodents,” Asner said.
</p>

  An exploratory 2022 Mailman School of Public Health study found that local perception of equitable trash disposal options may have an equal or greater effect on litter than the actual amount of litter options available.

  This study came partially in response to the city’s removal of over 200 trash cans from Harlem in 2018 in an attempt to reduce misuse of trash cans as household waste receptacles, since they are intended to serve exclusively as litter receptacles. The policy caused public uproar and a steep increase in street trash in the area, reflected in a 2018 study by the Philadelphia Behavioral Science Initiative, which demonstrated that when trash receptacles decrease, litter increases.

  Signe Mortensen, one of the lead organizers of West Harlem’s Team Up to Clean Up trash pick-up group, suggested that a relatively weak presence of business development groups may be contributing to the trash in the area.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I find that in other areas of the city, that are stronger business development groups where they're actually putting money into the pot to clean up the streets,” Mortensen said. “So we’re just so many … local mom and pops around here. We don’t have that kind of, you know, business development groups.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Adrian Kondratowicz, founder of an art-based trash clean-up initiative called TRASH Project, also spoke to how the geography of CB9 could be influencing the amount of trash on the streets.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “So what’s happening is our trash cans are not set for the volume of trash that we actually produce and they don’t have lids,” Kondratowicz said. “So what happens when wind goes through … stuff goes out, and then the rats go after it and then the birds carry it all around to see things and stuff like that. So that is the number one cause. We are on the hill here. It’s all exposed. All this wind is coming in. We’re getting hit first.”

            <p class="g-body subhed">Community Cleanups</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Team Up to Clean Up and TRASH Project were both active throughout the pandemic, when trash was piling up on streets and sidewalks due to reduced service, budget cuts, and work-from-home lifestyles.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  However, Kondratowicz also noticed an increase in community cleanup efforts during the pandemic.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We had like an uptick, you know, like our cleanups went from the usual suspects showing up to, like, having 20, 30, 40, 50 people wanting to help out,” Kondratowicz said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Mortensen observed the same increase in both trash and volunteers.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “So around [August and September 2020], the streets started getting noticeably much worse,” Mortensen said. “And so, what we see is what sticks with us, right? So people see it, people want to do something.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In Mortensen’s experience, the community cleanups have benefited the neighborhood, not only from an environmental perspective but also from a social one.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We become unified as a group,” Mortensen said. “We get to know each other at the same time as beautifying our streets and, and boy does it, when you look at what you’ve done together on a street, it can change your mentality.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While these volunteer cleanups have greatly diminished the amount of street trash in West Harlem, community organizers believe these solutions do not offer the consistency and long-term viability necessary for maintaining clean streets.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “These types of [community trash pick-up] initiatives sometimes fall short when they’re planned through an [corporate volunteer] agency unless there’s some consistent community commitment,” Kondratowicz said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Asner commented further on the responsibility of community members.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I don’t think it should be up to community members at large to organize volunteers as, you know, policy to keep the streets clean,” Asner said. “It’s a nice complement, and sometimes it has a role, during busy times or when things happen, like COVID, but I certainly don’t think it’s a good public policy model that the city rely upon volunteers to clean trash.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body subhed">Sustainable Solutions</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Creating more sustainable solutions to the trash problem may require city intervention. WE ACT has endorsed the Zero Waste bill package that would set a citywide waste diversion goal to be met by 2030 and mandate residential curbside composting, which could act as a long-term sustainable solution. The Robust Zero Waste bill package was introduced in April to New York City Council by members of the Progressive Caucus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Carforo suggested that composting may be a possible solution to the trash problem. Composting carries a wide array of benefits that help address the issue, such as reducing the amount of waste in landfills that may produce greenhouse gases, ridding the streets of rats that congregate around trash, creating micro-hauling jobs for people to transport composted waste to different community gardens, and fostering more green spaces by nourishing the soil.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[I]f there’s no more organic waste in your garbage bags, there’s a lot less interesting things for pests to be poking around in there for,” Carforo said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Brotherhood Sister Sol, a West Harlem-based comprehensive education and training program for young people, raises awareness about composting and helps the community build composting skills.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The reason why community members do not compost as much is in part because “it’s a hard, laborious process,” according to Nando Rodriguez, environmental program coordinator at Brotherhood Sister Sol.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If you don’t have the facility and the means to do so, [you] can be very quickly discouraged to do so,” Rodriguez said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  DSNY currently operates about <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/nyc-food-scrap-drop-off-locations">15 food scrap drop-off composting sites</a> spread out across West Harlem and Hamilton Heights. But Brotherhood Sister Sol is pushing for the establishment of 1,000 composting sites in every borough. By making composting more accessible, Rodriguez hopes that residents will be encouraged to practice it more.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If we made it easier for our residents and our community and our businesses to actually be a part of their environmental solutions … I think more and more people would be willing to do it,” Rodriguez said.
